# Contributing to the repository
 - Got this smooth CONTRIBUTING.md from Fredrik August Malmo

To retain the sanity of our team members, and optimize our workflow, we've
decided to adopt a lean version of `git-flow`
(ref. https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). Our version
works as following.
 
## General info when working with the repo
 
To keep track of who's doing what, it is very helpful to create issues for whatever
you're doing, moving it to "In progress" in the kanban board (project board), and assigning
yourself. This way, we can easily see what is being done, and by who.
 
If possible, tag it with a milestone as well, so we know when we can expect it to
be done.
 
## Starting the development of a new feature
 
To start working on a new feature, checkout to a new branch with a name following
the template of `feature/<name of feature>`. This makes it easy to distinguish
branches related to features/hotfixes/etc. from one another. If the branch is
to fall out of sync with `master`, please update it before merging into `master`.
 
When you are done working on your feature, and you deem it apt for merging into
master, create a merge request (pull request if you prefer github-lingo) requesting
your branch to be merged into `master`.
 
After doing this, we say that your branch is in _review stage_. When it is in
this state, try your best to refrain from pushing more changes. Now, you wait for
someone from your team (preferrably several) to review your code, and either
request changes, or approve.
 
When your MR (merge request) has been approved, merge it into master, and delete
the feature branch you worked on (this is to avoid a situation where you have
potentially hundreds of inactive branches laying around).
 
## Fixing something (hotfix)
 
Do the exact same as when developing a new feature, except name the branch
`hotfix/<short description>`.
 
These MRs should preferrably be rather short.
 
## Incorporating others' changes (in their branch) into your feature
 
If you are developing a feature, and you rely on changes someone made in another
branch, try your best to avoid merging their entire branch into yours, as that
will essentially make the other MR redundant.
 
If you simply need one commit, you can use `git cherry-pick`.
 
## Git messages
 
Try your best to give a proper description of the changes made in the commit title,
and a more in-depth description in the commit body.
 
If relevant, link to the issue relevant to your changes by typing a # followed by the issue
number. GitLab will pick up on this, and create a hotlink to the issue page, and vice-versa.
 
That means no commit messages like:
 
- `tasklist.java`
- `Fikset mer p√• task.java`
 
etc.
 
The reasoning for this is that it makes it very hard for others to know what
changes have been made without digging through each commit.
