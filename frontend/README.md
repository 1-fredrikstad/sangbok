# Sangbok-Frontend

Denne pakken representerer frontenden til prosjektet

## Utvikling

Etter å ha klonet repoet så kan du kjøre frontenden ved å skrive

```bash
    npm install
```

For å laste den dependencies. Deretter må man genere typer utifra backenden vår. Kjør derfor

```bash
    npm run apollo:generate-types
```

Deretter skal du kunne kjøre `npm run dev` for å kjøre opp utviklingsmiljøet

### Linting & formatting your code.

```bash
    npm run lint
```
